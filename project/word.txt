Life is what you make it so many are coming at it wrong 
Victims seeing that life happens 'to them' life is bad for them 
But life is life in and of itself, it simply is what it is 
Shakespeare was a genius. "There is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so".
We are obsessed by the truth, yet we don't live true to ourselves
You are a human after all, who can change your perspective on things 
See things differently, feel things differently. Because you have cognition
Yet you're stuck, failing in a life of waiting and cursing 
When you could be discovering and creating 
If only you come from a place of creation 
Rather than having to know, your life would transform miraculously
